# Day 2 — Multi-Container Full Stack Application using Docker Compose  
**React Client + Node.js Server + MongoDB**

---

## Introduction

On Day 2 of Week 5, my goal was to understand how real production applications run multiple services together instead of a single container.  

Previously, on Day 1, I had learned how to run a single Node.js application inside Docker. While that was useful, it did not reflect real-world systems. In reality, most applications consist of:

- A frontend (client)
- A backend (server)
- A database

These parts are usually deployed as **separate services**, but they must still communicate with each other.

So for this task, I built a **multi-container application** using Docker Compose where:

- A React client runs in one container  
- A Node.js + Express server runs in another container  
- MongoDB runs in a third container  

All three services start together using one command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Planning the Architecture

Before writing any code, I thought about what components I needed:

A client for UI

A server for API logic

A database for storing data

I decided to structure the project like this:
