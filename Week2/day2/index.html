          <h2>Kedarkantha Trek</h2>
          <p>
            Kedarkantha is one of the most loved winter treks in Uttarakhand, famous for its pristine snow trails, dense pine forests, and breathtaking summit views. What makes this trek especially popular is that it remains accessible even during peak winter months, allowing trekkers to experience deep snow without technical mountaineering skills.
          </p>
          <p>
           The trail begins from the small Himalayan village of Sankri, where traditional wooden houses, warm hospitality, and local culture set the tone for the journey ahead. As the trek progresses, it passes through thick forests of pine and oak, opening up to wide clearings blanketed in snow. Juda Ka Talab, a frozen high-altitude lake along the route, is one of the most scenic camping spots and often becomes a highlight of the trek.

            The trail follows the Tons River and passes through remote villages such as Osla and Seema, where traditional wooden architecture and age-old customs are still preserved.
