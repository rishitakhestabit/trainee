    <h1>Trainee Training Repository</h1>

    <p>
      This repository contains my training and bootcamp work. I will keep adding
      new weeks and daily tasks as I continue my learning journey.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 1 – Bootcamp Day 1</h2>

    <p>
      In Week 1 Day 1, I focused on understanding the system from a low level using
      the terminal only. I learned basic concepts of operating systems, explored
      system information using Node.js, and practiced performance benchmarking.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tasks included setting up Node.js using NVM, creating a system
      introspection script, and comparing Stream vs Buffer performance using
      large files.
    </p>

    <p>
      This repository will be continuously updated with more weeks, tasks,
      scripts, and reports as the training progresses.
