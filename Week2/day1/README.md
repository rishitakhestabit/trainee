# Uttarakhand Travel Vlog – Semantic HTML Project

## Project Description
This project is a simple travel blog webpage created using **only HTML5** as part of **Day 1 – HTML5 + Semantic Layout** assignment.  
The blog focuses on travel vlogs and destinations in Uttarakhand, including places like **Munsiyari, Harsil, Auli**, and nearby Himalayan regions.

The main goal of this project is to understand **HTML structure, semantic elements, accessibility basics, without using CSS or `<div>` tags.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

- How an HTML document is structured
- How to use semantic HTML5 tags instead of generic `<div>`
- How to organize content meaningfully using sections and articles
- How to embed images and YouTube videos
- How to create basic forms with validation
- How accessibility features like `alt`, ARIA labels, and proper landmarks work
- How to document a project using a README file

## HTML Fundamentals Used

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` to ensure HTML5 standards
- `<html lang="en">` to define the page language
- `<head>` for metadata like charset, description, viewport, and title
- `<body>` for all visible content

Metadata such as charset, description, and viewport were added to improve accessibility, SEO, and responsiveness.

## Semantic HTML5 Structure

The page is built entirely using semantic HTML elements:

- `<header>` for site title and navigation
- `<nav>` for navigation links
- `<main>` for the main content area
- `<section>` to group related content
- `<article>` for individual travel stories
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images and video
- `<aside>` for sidebar content like recent posts and categories
- `<footer>` for copyright and contact details

No `<div>` tags are used anywhere in the project.

## Images and Media

- Images are stored locally and embedded using `<img>`
- Each image includes a meaningful `alt` attribute
- Images are grouped with captions using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- A YouTube travel vlog preview is embedded using an `<iframe>`

---

## Forms and User Interaction

A subscription form is included using semantic form elements:

- `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, and `<legend>`
- `<label>` properly associated with inputs
- `<input type="email">` with built-in validation
- `<select>` dropdown for destination preference
- `<button>` for form submission

---

## Accessibility Features

Basic accessibility practices are followed:

- Descriptive `alt` text for all images
- ARIA labels for navigation and form inputs where needed
- Logical heading order (`h1` to `h3`)
- Proper semantic landmarks (`header`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`)
- Keyboard-accessible navigation and form elements

---

## Constraints Followed

- Only HTML used (no CSS, no JavaScript)
- No `<div>` elements
- Semantic HTML5 only
- Accessibility considered
- Local images and embedded media included
